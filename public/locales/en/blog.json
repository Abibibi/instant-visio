            "content": "At the inception of [Instant Visio](https:\/\/instantvisio.com), the challenge was to find a video chat technology that would be reliable, easy to install, simple to use and supported by a large number of devices.\r\n\t\t\t\r\nIt was of utmost importance for us to be able to video chat without having the user to install additional software, all while ensuring that both video and audio channels were securely encrypted.\r\n\r\n[Daily.co](https:\/\/daily.co) was the video chat platform used during the \u201C[startupschool.org](https:\/\/startupschool.org)\u201D formation program organized by the renown Y Combinator, and we immediately considered including it in our benchmark. Even though the solution was technically sound, we thought that the English-only interface would discourage non-English speaking users.\r\n\r\nSo that Sunday afternoon, we decided to ask a few questions through the \"chat widget\" of [Daily.co](https:\/\/daily.co).\r\n\r\nThen... \u00AB Someone \u00BB (:) hello Nina) answered to our technical questions and told us that Daily.co\'s API can open video chat sessions and makes it possible to personalize them, including the translation of the interface to other languages. But that we would have to pay for it.\r\n\r\nWe were telling Nina what we were looking for when, in a moment of serendipity, another person, Kwin, joined the conversation and offered us a free access to their premium account which would enable us to use the API for free, and to offer our service to anybody who needs Instant Visio.\r\n\r\nThanks to the very comprehensive documentation of the [Daily.co](https:\/\/daily.co)\'s API, we were able to build our platform from the ground up within one day.\r\n\r\nWe are very grateful for the collaboration with [Daily.co](https:\/\/daily.co) for it has made it possible to put their technology at the service of vulnerable persons longing for a visual connection with their loved ones, especially in these trying times.\r\n\r\nStay safe everyone!"
